# Redux Assignment

## Number API Redux Integration

Setup redux in a React project. You dont need to create any UI or components.

Then setup the redux store, reducers and actions for retrieving number facts using [Number API](http://numbersapi.com).

So that we can send

`FETCH_FACT` along with a number to the store and it then hits the API and return the response.
