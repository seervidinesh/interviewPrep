# Implement Integer Partition Algorithm

The partition of an integer is a way of writing it as a sum of positive integers. For example, the partitions of the number 5 are:

```
5
4+1
3+2
2+2+1
2+1+1+1
1+1+1+1+1
```

Notice that changing the order of the summands will not create a different partition.

Can you write a Javascript program that lists out integer partitions of a number `n` as above?

Hint: This problem can be solved easily using Dynamic Programming
