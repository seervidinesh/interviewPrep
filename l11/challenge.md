# Coding Challenge

## 1. Binary Tree Postorder Traversal

Given a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example:

Input: [1,null,2,3]
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3

Output: [3,2,1]

Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

## 2. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal

Given a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example:

Input: [1,null,2,3]
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3

Output: [1,2,3]

Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
