# React JS Assignment

## Build a Reddit client using ReactJS and Reddit API.

Reddit, the social networking site has a [free api](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api) that gives you almost everything you need to access from Reddit through an API.

Build a simple client using ReactJS that has the following features - 

1. The home page of the React app should show all the topics from the home page of Reddit.
2. Clicking on a URL should take to the comments page inside the application itself. You should load all the comments of a particular discussion in your app itself.
3. Clicking on a subreddit URL should take the user to the top posts in that sub-reddit.
4. You can design the app anyway you like. Simple designs are fine as React is the main criteria for evaluation here.
5. For fetching the API results, you can use `fetch`.
