# Day 3 Assignments

## 1. High Order Function (higher-order.js)
Can you give an example for a higher order function?

## Recursion (recursion.js)
Write a Recursive function to calculate the sum of all integers in a JS array.

As in

```js
sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);   // Should return 15
```

## Currying (currying.js)
If a function named `sayHello` takes two parameters `greeting` and `name`, can you write a program that curries it into a new function named `helloAttainU` which only takes `greeting` and `name` is always passed down to `sayHello` as `Attain U`.

## Map, Reduce, Some, Sort Filter and Find (reduce.js)
Using `Array.reduce`, write a program that finds sum of all integers in an array.

## Chaining (chaining.js)
Can you give an example for chaining in JS?

## Function methods - apply, bind and call (fun-methods.js)
Can you write a program that calls console.log indirectly using apply, bind and call?
