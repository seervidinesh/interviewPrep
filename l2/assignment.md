# Week 1, Day 2 Assignments

## 1. Function Constructor (function-constructor.js)

Please write an example for a function constructor

## 2. Can you give an example for Closures? (closure.js)

If you can provide something in the context of DOM, where closures are often used.

## 3. ES6 Class example (es6-class.js)

Create an ES6 class named `Animal` with the following properties

```js
familyName // String value
sayFamilyName() // Prints family name to the screen
```

Then create a class named `Cat` which extends the above `Animal` class and should contain the following properties.

```js
breedName // String value
sayBreedName() // Prints breed name to the screen
```

At the end, the below code should work: 

```js
let cat = new Cat();
cat.familyName = 'Carnivora';
cat.breedName = 'Persian';
cat.sayFamilyName();
cat.sayBreedName();
cat.
```
